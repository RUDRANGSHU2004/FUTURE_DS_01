# FUTURE_INTERNS
🛒 E-commerce Sales and Performance Dashboard
This repository contains the source files for a dynamic Power BI dashboard designed to monitor and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends within an e-commerce operation.

✨ Project Overview
The dashboard provides a visual interface for exploring the sales data sourced from the ecommerce_sales_34500.csv file. It aims to deliver actionable insights into sales volume, revenue, product performance, and customer behavior.

🛠️ Components
The project consists of two primary artifacts:

f_I1.pbix (Power BI Report): The main report file containing:

Data Model: Built specifically to analyze the e-commerce sales data, including relationships, hierarchies, and calculated measures (DAX) for metrics like Total Sales, Average Order Value, etc.

Custom Design: Utilizes custom themes and visual elements (like the referenced "Tidal" theme and "cyber futuristic" gradient) to ensure a polished, branded, and modern look.

Layout: Structured pages for intuitive data exploration and drill-down analysis.

Security: Includes security bindings, suggesting potential implementation of Role-Level Security (RLS) to manage data access.

ecommerce_sales_34500.csv: The raw dataset used to populate the Power BI report. This file contains transactional data necessary for the sales analysis.
